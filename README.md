About the project - The scope of this suite is to test some of the functionalities of the Login Page and AddtoCart Page on the website: https://www.saucedemo.com/ 


Prerequisites

1. PyCharm 2024.3.2

The Python code for these tests was written using PyCharm 2024.3.2. The version of Python can be checked in cmd.exe using the command: "python --version". In my case, it is Python 3.12.

2. Unittest library

Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of software are tested. The Python Unittest is a built-in testing framework that provides a set of tools for testing our codeâ€™s functionality in a more systematic and organized manner.

3. Selenium Module 4.28.1

It is the main tool used to automate web browser interaction from Python

5. HTMLTestRunner-rv 1.1.2

It is a third-party library made to create HTML reports of the tests conducted. These reports are made in a human-readable presentation.

Installation and setup

1. A folder needs to be created in the computer, where the code to run the app will be stored
2. A new project needs to be opened in PyCharm, a virtual environment needs to be created and for, each page where tests will be made, a PythonFile needs to be opened
3. In each PythonFile the Unittest Library and the Selenium Module will be used to automate the tests
4. For each set of tests 2 mandatory functions need to be created:
      - the SetUp function - for the economy of code all the steps prior to the actual test are written here (opening the website, maximizing the window, etc.)
      - the TearDown function - all the steps needed after running the test are written here (closing the website and browser)

Test Cases description

1. LoginTests - for the website https://www.saucedemo.com/ I have tested the responses for the different types of login:
   - testWrongCredentials asserts that, in case of wrong credentials, the error message is displayed
   - testSuccesfulLogin asserts that, in case of successful login, the current URL changes
   - testClickLoginNoCredentials asserts that, in case of no credentials, the error message is displayed
   - testGlitchUser asserts that, in case of an implicit wait of 10 seconds, eventually the current URL changes

2. CartTests - after successfully logging in I have tested the following:
   - testCurrentURL - asserts that the current URL is the resulting one from the successful logging-in
   - testDropdownSortAscending - for the case when we want to sort the products on the page in ascending order it asserts that the sorting is correct and the products are ordered ascendingly
   - testAddToCart - asserts that, in case a product has been added to the cart, the "add to cart" button for that product becomes unavailable on the main page
   - testNumberProductsInCart - asserts that every time a product is added to the cart the number near the cart icon on the upper right part of the page is incremented
   - testCheckProductsInCart - asserts that, when clicking on the cart icon on the upper right part of the page, the URL changes to the "cart page"

Running the tests

Because Unittest allows you to test the smallest testable parts of the software, the following options are available:
- to run a test, one at a time - for example pressing the play button near the "testWrongCredentials" will run only this test
- to run all the tests from a page - for example pressing the play button near the class "LoginTests" will run all the tests from this page

Test Suite:
- it is composed of the tests from LoginTests and CartTests
- using the decorator "@unittest.skip" we can choose which tests to skip
- the results can be seen in the generated report
